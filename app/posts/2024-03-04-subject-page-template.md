description: Developing a template for subject pages, so they all have a consistent look and feel.

## What we did
We developed the scope of subject pages available on the website. There was already a subject page for maths, physics and engineers for physics but these were not hosted on the navigation. 

So we created a new template for the subject pages, based on previous user research, so that we can expand the amount of subjects hosted on the website. We did this to make sure they all had a consistent look and feel. And improve their navigation by adding them into the 'is teaching right for me?' category page, so users could access this content easily.

## Why did we do this work? 

We know from previous user research that perspective teacher trainees want to know more about the subject. They want to know:
- what the teaching environment is like, ie. classroom behaviour and lesson plans
- the qualifications and funding for the subject
- why they should choose this subject

## First section 

'Become a [subject name] teacher'

You'll use the first section to say briefly what this subject is and sell the subject/ why users should teach it.
You'll also include a line about the bursaries and scholarships available. 

## Second section

This section can be used for a quote or more information to introduce what teaching this subject includes.

## Third section

This section is focused on showing the themes of the curriculum for key stages 3 to 5. It's important to try and show how teacher would get pupils interested in themes. So using examples 'like creating a robot car', is a good insight for users.

Open this section by linking to the gov.uk national curriculum (do not link directly to a pdf).

The bottom of this section will include a link to oak academy or a trusted website with an example of a lesson.

## Fourth section

This is a quote section. It would be best if this section could be used to emphasise what teaching in a classroom is like.

## Fifth section

The 'Check your qualifications' section

This section should be the same for all subjects except for the 3rd paragraph. Which will be taken from the data team to show a few subjects users have a degree in that have decided to teach this subject. Choose degrees that aren't normally associated with this subject, to show anyone can teach this subject.

## Sixth section

The section should be the same except for the wording around the bursaries and scholarships.
