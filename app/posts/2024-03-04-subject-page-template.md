description: Developing a template for subject pages, so they all have a consistent look and feel.

## What we did
The scope for subject pages available on the website has been developed. There was already a subject page for maths, physics and engineers for physics but these were not hosted on the navigation. 

So a new template has been created for the subject pages, based on previous user research, so that when the amount of subjects hosted on the website is expanded. This was done to make sure they all had a consistent look and feel. Also, to improve the navigation to the pages and users could access this content easily, the subject pages were added into the 'is teaching right for me?' category page.

## Why did we do this work? 

We know from previous user research that perspective teacher trainees want to know more about the subject. Users want to know:
- what the teaching environment is like, ie. classroom behaviour and lesson plans
- the qualifications and funding for the subject
- why they should choose this subject

## First section 

![test](/images/subject-specific/01-subject-page-header.png)

'Become a [subject name] teacher'

This first section can be used to say briefly what this subject is and sell the subject/ why users should teach it.
Also, it should include a line about the bursaries and scholarships available. 

## Second section

![test](/images/subject-specific/02-subject-page-2nd-section.png)

This section can be used for a quote or more information to introduce what teaching this subject includes.

## Third section

![test](/images/subject-specific/03-subject-page-curriculum.png)

This section is focused on showing the themes of the curriculum for key stages 3 to 5. It's important to try and show how teachers would get pupils interested in themes. So using examples 'like creating a robot car', is a good insight for users.

The first line of this section should link to the gov.uk national curriculum (do not link directly to a pdf).

The last line of this section should include a link to Oak Academy or a trusted website with an example of a lesson.

## Fourth section

![test](/images/subject-specific/04-subject-page-quote.png)

This is a quote section. It would be best if this section could be used to emphasise what teaching in a classroom is like.

## Fifth section

![test](/images/subject-specific/05-subject-page-qualifications.png)

This section should be the same for all subjects except for the 3rd paragraph. Which will be taken from the data team to show a few subjects users have a degree in that have decided to teach this subject. Choose degrees that aren't normally associated with this subject, to show anyone can teach this subject.

## Sixth section

![test](/images/subject-specific/06-subject-page-funding.png)

The section should be the same except for the wording around the bursaries and scholarships, which will depend on the funding available for that specific subject.
