## Why did we do this work?

The Department for Education (DfE) launched a new advertising and marketing campaign in Jan 2024. The campaign focuses on how a career in teaching not only allows you to make a difference to the lives of others but it also gives you the opportunity to grow. Key themes the campaign encompasses are around career and pay progression, and continuous personal development (CPD). We wanted to update the messaging on the website and also look at areas where we could create new content to reflect this.

## Updating the content

We added messaging to align with the campaign into: 

* our service proposition 
* the introduction text on some of our category pages 
* other pages where relevant 

## Future considerations

We will continue to develop content to tie in with the campaign, including the themes of career progression and CPD, to inspire people to get into teaching. And we will look to create a new section on the website for it to sit, making it easily accessible.
