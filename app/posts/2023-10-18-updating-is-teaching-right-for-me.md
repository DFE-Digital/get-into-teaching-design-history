## Why did we do this work?

From user research, we identified that we should make it easier for users to find content that they needed at the early stage of a journey into teaching.

To address this, as part of navigation improvements to the site, we decided to change the existing ‘Is teaching right for me’ content page into a full category page.

This makes it easier to immediately see the content pages in this section and creates a clear home for additional content as we build out the site in the future.

## Updating the content

To make it easier for users to see the content pages within this section, we created a new category page.

We also: 

* moved the salaries and benefits page into this section and updated the URL to teacher pay and benefits, which matches the page title and supports SEO
* moved the teachers' pension scheme page into this section
* moved internships and get school experience into the ‘Is teaching right for me’ category
* moved career changers page into the ‘Is teaching right for me’ category
* moved the orphan 'teach in further education' and 'become an early years teacher' pages into this section


## Future considerations

We will monitor the performance of the page and test the page with users. We will also build out the content with a new page on job prospects of teaching.
