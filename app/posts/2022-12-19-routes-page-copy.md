title: Changing how we talk about routes into teacher training
description: Changing our content around routes into teacher training to match better with Find postgraduate teacher training.

The way we used to break down teacher training on our ‘Train to be a teacher if you have a degree’ page did not match up with what candidates would then see on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).

Our old content emphasised the different routes — training with a school, with a university, through an apprenticeship, etc. But we know from user research that candidates get confused with all these different routes when the actual content of teacher training does not vary much between them.

We redesigned the content to match up better with the way courses are broken down on Find and in the way that teacher training advisers describe them to candidates.

On Find, candidates can filter courses by salaried and qualification. We also know that this is how teacher training advisers explain the differences between courses to candidates. So we changed our content to match this.

We know from user research that candidates do not understand what qualified teacher status (QTS) is and the common misconception is that you need a PGCE to teach. According to teacher training advisers, many candidates accidentally apply for courses that only give them PGCE and not QTS.

Because of this, we wanted to put this important information at the top of the page to help candidates understand what they need to teach.
