## What we did

As part of our work to increase sign ups to our services, we wanted to update the design of our promo modules.

This included:

* making the promo block purple and more eye-catching
* using icons/illustrations rather than images

We implemented this new design on our [How to become a teacher page](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/steps-to-become-a-teacher).

## What we'll do next

We'll monitor the performance of our promo modules to try and measure the impact of our new design.
