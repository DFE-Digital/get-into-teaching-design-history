## User insight

Our [How to become a teacher page](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/steps-to-become-a-teacher) (previously Steps to become a teacher) has information around the steps that you need to take to apply for teacher training.

Our user research found that users wanted information beyond their application, and expected to see content on their teacher training year, applying for teaching jobs, and what happens when in post.

## Changes made

Because of this, we added 3 extra sections to the page:

- start your teacher training
- apply for a teaching role
- start your career

We also changed the name of the page to more closely match with key search terms.

Keyword research found that How to become a teacher had a much higher average search volume than Steps to become a teacher.

## How we worked

We spoke with the Teaching Vacancies team and ECF team to understand what content might be useful to users on these topics.

We also worked with the Find and Apply teams to review the content in our Find a teacher training course and Apply for teacher training sections.

## Future considerations

We also know from user research that users value more personalised information.

We tested a new component at the top of this page where users could click on it, answer a few questions about their circumstances (i.e. their qualifications, subject interested in teaching), and then they would be served specific content tailored their answers.

We plan on prototyping this personalised component further and doing more testing of this page with users.
