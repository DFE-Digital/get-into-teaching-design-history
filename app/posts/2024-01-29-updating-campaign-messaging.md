## Why did we do this work?

The Department for Education (DfE) launched a new advertising and marketing campaign in Jan 2024. The campaign focuses on how a career in teaching not only allows you to make a difference to the lives of others but also gives you the opportunity to grow. Key themes of the campaign are around career and pay progression, and continuous personal development (CPD). We wanted to update the messaging on the website and also look at areas where we could create new content to reflect this.

## Updating the content

We added messaging to align with the campaign into: 

* our service proposition 
* the introduction text on some of our category pages 
* other pages where relevant 

For example, we added some content around the benefits of getting qualified teacher status (QTS) to emphasise the ongoing support available as an early careers teacher (ECT). https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/steps-to-become-a-teacher. 

And we updated language used around salaries to ensure it’s consistent with the language used in the campaign. The wording was updated to say, get a minimum starting salary of £30,000. 

 * From our user research we know that career progression is a key consideration for people who are thinking about a career in teaching. We worked with teacher training advisers and policy teams to create a new content page, a Q&A giving a realistic portrayal of career progression in teaching.  

 * We also created bespoke landing pages for the campaigns team to be able to drive traffic from organic, paid search and social to targeted pages focusing on the key themes of the campaign. 

## Future considerations

We will continue to develop content to tie in with the campaign, including the themes of career progression and CPD, to inspire people to get into teaching. And we will look to create a new section on the website for it to sit, making it easily accessible.
