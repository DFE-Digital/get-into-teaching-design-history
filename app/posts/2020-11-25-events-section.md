To make the events section easier for users, we updated the the ui on a number fo fronts:

## Landing & Category page:

- Added snippets prior to search box to explain each evetn type to help users devide how to search.
- Added "Some events have moved online" box. 
- Updated colours. Weve limited colours to just two, purple to highlight TTT events and blue for all others. 
- UI changes to how boxes are displayed.
- Remove snippet and is oftern repetition of event title.

## individual Page

- Moved boxed information from sidebar to main content column, as analytics indicate it wil be engaged with more in this position. 
- CTAs now at top and bottom of page so users who skim and users who digest can both find
