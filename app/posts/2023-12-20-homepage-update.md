We needed to push mailing list sign ups, so we made some tweaks to the homepage where we embedded the start of the sign up journey into the page, rather than a link in the main hero banner.

Some other minor recent tweaks were made as part of a service proposition update, this included content updates and calling out the three main link sections at the bottom of the page.


{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [{
      text: "Homepage screenshot",
      img: { src: "01-homepage-screenshot.jpg" }
    }, {
      text: "Steps page mobile screenshot",
      img: { src: "01-homepage-mobile-screenshot.png" }
    }]
}) }}
