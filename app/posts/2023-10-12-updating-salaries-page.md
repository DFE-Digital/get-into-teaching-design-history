description: Updating our salaries page to better represent the average teacher pay.

## Why did we do this work?

When we updated the salaries page with the new pay award, the teacher pay team highlighted some interesting information about salaries and how our page is structured.

They pointed out that the average classroom teacher pay is better than we were really showing.

Our old page had 2 tables to show the main pay range and upper pay range.

They pointed out that the majority of teachers are actually on the upper pay range, so by having these tables separate, we were not representing the average teacher pay as clearly as we could.

## Updating the content

To better reflect teacher pay, we combined the main pay range and upper pay range tables to create 1 qualified teacher salary table. This gives users a more realistic idea of what to expect.

We also made sure to indicate what a typical teacher could earn by including the following:

A typical teacher with 5 years’ experience could earn at least £41,333, or more in London.

We also added more information about the additional payments teachers could expect to receive.

We also renamed the page to target the search term 'teacher pay'.

This allowed us to target a relatively high search volume phrase while still being accurate (we cannot, for example, call it 'teacher pay scales' because while this is a higher search volume term, the teacher pay team have told us that this is not accurate).

## Future considerations

We know that users are also interested in career progression, but not at the same stage in their journey as when they're just looking for overall headline figures of what they could earn.

We want to create content in future that covers career progression, which may include splitting up some of the content from this page.
