We know that users are experiencing a disjointed experience when going from a marketing campaign to the GIT website and believe that we could further engage users by offering a more seamless experience.

Through testing a landing page that looks and feels like the associated paid social ad, we increased the conversion rate.


{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [{
      text: "Marketing page desktop screenshot",
      img: { src: "marketing-page.png" }
    }, {
      text: "Marketing page mobile screenshot",
      img: { src: "marketing-page-mobile.png" }
    }]
}) }}
