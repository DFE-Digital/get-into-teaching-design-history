## What we did

As part of the campaign launch, the content and partnerships team planned a partnership with BuzzFeed. We therefore decided to create a landing page that BuzzFeed could direct users to who have engaged with the content on BuzzFeed and who wanted to find out more.

{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [{
      text: "BuzzFeed landing page on desktop",
      img: { src: "01-buzzfeed-landing-page.png" }
    }, {
      text: "BuzzFeed landing page on mobile",
      img: { src: "02-buzzfeed-landing-page.png" }
    }]

}) }}
