User research was carried out to better understand what users expected from a steps page in terms of content and design. 

From the research we learnt that the steps journey was less linear and more of a checklist depending on where the users are in their journey into teaching. The design was updated to reflect that, along with the graphic on the homepage banner.

## Homepage banner design
The design was updated to reflect the findings on the homepage banner as well

{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [{
      text: "Steps page screenshot",
      img: { src: "02-steps-page-screenshot.jpg" }
    }, {
      text: "Steps page mobile screenshot",
      img: { src: "02-steps-page-mobile-screenshot.jpg" }
    }, {
      text: "Homepage banner design",
      img: { src: "01-hp-design.png" }
    }, {
      text: "Homepage banner mobile design",
      img: { src: "01-hp-mobile-design.png" }
    }]
}) }}
